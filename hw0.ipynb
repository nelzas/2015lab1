In this class, we will be using a variety of tools that will require some initial configuration. To ensure everything goes smoothly moving forward, we will setup the majority of those tools in this homework. **It is very important that you do this setup as soon as possible**.

    "\n",
    "In a gameshow, contestants try to guess which of 3 closed doors contain a cash prize (goats are behind the other two doors). Of course, the odds of choosing the correct door are 1 in 3. As a twist, the host of the show occasionally opens a door after a contestant makes his or her choice. This door is always one of the two the contestant did not pick, and is also always one of the goat doors (note that it is always possible to do this, since there are two goat doors). At this point, the contestant has the option of keeping his or her original choice, or swtiching to the other unopened door. The question is: is there any benefit to switching doors? The answer surprises many people who haven't heard the question before.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is how you ought to work with them (our github tutorial has an example of this process on the cs109/testing repository):\n",
    "\n",
    "First fork the lab from the github web interface. For example, the first lab is at: https://github.com/harelc/2015lab1 . The fork button is at the upper right corner of the page. Press it.\n",
    "When it asks you where to fork the lab, choose your own github userid. The web interface will then take you to the web page for your fork. Mine is at: https://github.com/rahuldave/2015lab1 .\n",
    "Now look for the clone url at the bottom right of the page. If you set up your ssh keys, use the ssh url, else use the https url.\n",
    "Clone your fork down to your machine by obtaining a terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app or equivalent on mac and git-bash.exe on windows). Change (cd) into an appropriate folder and clone by doing git clone url where the url is the one in step 3.\n",
    "Add a remote for the original repository that you forked from. We'll call this remote course. The command for this, for example, for the first lab is: git remote add course git@github.com:harelc/2015lab1.git or git remote add course https://github.com/harelc/2015lab1.git\n",
    "Now you have a local repository. Start the ipython notebook in the repository and run the labs. DO NOT run the notebooks ending in _original.ipynb. These are simply copies of the labs. We made these copies so that you can update them from our course remote in case we make any changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Lab 1 we'll start with the  pythonpandas, followed by babypython, and finally git notebooks. The git notebook can be run under the ipython notebook. But the git commands can also be run directly on a terminal, which is probably the best place to do them...you can keep the notebook on the side to read as you follow along). So after once having read the tutorial, as described earlier, you now get to work through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you follow along, you can add in your own notes, and try your own variations. As you are doing this, dont forget to continue doing the \"add/commit/push\" cycle, so that you save and version your changes, and push them to your fork. This typically looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- git add .\n",
    "- git commit -a\n",
    "- git push\n",
    "\n",
    "In case we make changes, you can incorporate them into your repo by doing: git fetch course; git checkout course/master -- labname_original.ipynb where labname.ipynb is the lab in question. An \"add/commit/push\" cycle will make sure these changes go into your fork as well. If you intend to work on the changed file, simply copy the file to another one and work on it. Or you could make a new branch. Remember that this fork is YOUR repository, and you can do to it what you like.\n",
